## What I would like to say about this course.
- the course is very interesting at the moment.
- the mentor examines in detail all the subtleties and nuances.
- interesting tasks for independent activity.
- the current moment the course is not over (perhaps something else will be added to this list and to the lists below :smiley:).


## What is missing in the course?
- the course lacks examples of use in a real application. :confused:

## There are still 3 months of training ahead, programming is power.
